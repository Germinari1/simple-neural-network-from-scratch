# simple deep neural network from scratch
This project aims to build a deep neural network from scratch, without using high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It implements the forward and backward propagation algorithms for training a multi-layer neural network.

## Project Overview

The project covers the following aspects of building a deep neural network:

1. **Initialization**: Implement functions to initialize the parameters (weights and biases) for a 2-layer and an L-layer neural network.
2. **Forward Propagation**: Implement the forward propagation module, including linear forward, linear-activation forward, and the complete L-model forward propagation.
3. **Cost Function**: Compute the cross-entropy cost function for the predictions.
4. **Backward Propagation**: Implement the backward propagation module, including linear backward, linear-activation backward, and the complete L-model backward propagation.
5. **Update Parameters**: Update the parameters (weights and biases) using the computed gradients.

## Requirements and quick start

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

They can be installed by using the following commands:
```txt
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```
